# Install Mac Specific Software

## Homebrew

Homebrew is a command-line tool that lets you install software. It's useful for installing tools that are needed during development.

Watch the tutorial for [Installing Homebrew](https://www.loom.com/share/6d675407abf54da5b4cf93d257fcc1ab?from_recorder=1) to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

There may be further instructions on the terminal called "Next Steps", please follow them.

**Important:** If after installing Homebrew you start seeing an error on your command line:

```shell
zsh compinit: insecure directories, run compaudit for list.
Ignore insecure directories and continue [y] or abort compinit [n]?
```
